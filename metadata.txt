about=SecQuery is a tool for rendering geodesic buffers with a 
    specified number of sectors. Buffer radius can be specified 
    in cm, m, km, in, ft, mi, nmi or yd. The number of sectors
    and smoothness of buffer can be configured via user input. 
    The tool also provides the functionality of displaying 16 
    directional labels. The center point of the buffer can be
    entered manually or selected from the canvas. The buffer, 
    sectors and direction labels are added as Memory Layers. 
    A Point Layer and a CRS for this Layer are taken as input. 
    The data in a sector can be queried with a map tool which 
    identifies a sector from mouse click coordinates. The 
    queried data is added as a Memory Layer with Point data 
    of selected sector.The attribute table for these layers 
    are displayed.
